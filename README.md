Welcome to WebGraph (big)!
--------------------------

[WebGraph](http://webgraph.di.unimi.it/) is a framework for graph
compression aimed at studying web graphs. It provides simple ways to
manage very large graphs, exploiting modern compression techniques.

This big version of WebGraph can manage graphs as large as your core memory
allows. For graphs with less than 2^31 nodes, have a look at the [standard
version](https://github.com/vigna/webgraph).
