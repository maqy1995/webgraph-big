- Better toString() for graphs

- There are ImmutableGraph.loadOnce() around, which just throw exceptions.

- The successorBigArray() heuristic should be implemented in arc-labelled graphs, too.

- Eliminate offline variable from Transform.main() and streamline load process.

- The HyperBall localCheckList system should use a big set and a big array.

- Fix IntegerTriplesArcLabelledImmutableGraph to have long elements.

- Lazy iteration through batches for batch labelled graphs.
